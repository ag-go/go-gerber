# Bifilar coil

This is a design of a bifilar coil, meaning that when this design is
fabricated on a two-layer printed circuit board (PCB), there will be a
single bifilar coil wired primarily on the top copper layer.

The theory is that when you drive the coil with a sine wave at its
resonant frequency, it can transfer power at its greatest efficiency.

The beauty of this design is that it is parametric.

## How it is wound

Both coils are concentric and wind in the same direction.
Therefore the magnetic field from each coil section combines uniformly
with the other coil resulting in a stronger, cohesive field.

## Parametric design

In this design, coils can be created with varying trace widths, gaps
between traces, and number of spirals per coil. As a result, this
parametric design could theoretically be used for coils of any
manufacturable size (from microscopic on up).

## Example coils

In this section, we will document emperically-measured resistances
and resonant frequencies of fabricated coils as they become
available.

### Coil 1

Coil 1 consists of:

```
trace width = 0.15mm (6 mils)
gap width = 0.15mm
number of coils per spiral = 100
```

| From point | To point | DC resistance (Î©) | Resonant Frequency (Hz) |
|   :---:    |  :---:   |      :---:        |         :---:           |
|   hole2    |  hole4   |                   |                         |
|   hole4    |  hole5   |                   |                         |
