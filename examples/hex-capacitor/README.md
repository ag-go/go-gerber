# Hex (6-layer) capacitor

This is a design of a hex-layer capacitor, meaning that when this design is
fabricated on a six-layer printed circuit board (PCB), there will be 12
capacitor plates (two per layer) creating a dielectric field between the
traces within a single layer and between the traces across layers.

## Parametric design

In this design, plate wires can be created with varying trace widths,
gaps between traces, and overall size of the board. As a result, this
parametric design could theoretically be used for capacitors of any
manufacturable size (from microscopic on up).

This shows the various layers on a 100mm x 100mm PCB:

## Example capacitors

In this section, we will document emperically-measured
capacitances as they become available.

This capacitor uses a 1.6mm PCB thickness and measures 12.26nF.
